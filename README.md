Practice! We talking about __practice__!! :satisfied:


>If a coach says I miss __practice__, and y'all hear it, then that's that. I might've missed one __practice__ this year, but if somebody says 'He doesn't come to __practice__,' it could be one __practice__ out of all the __practices__ this year, that's enough. If I can't __practice__, I can't __practice__. If I'm hurt, I'm hurt. Simple as that. It's not about that at all. But it's easy to talk about and sum it up when you just talk about __practice__; we're sitting here, and I'm supposed to be the franchise player, and we're in here talking about __practice__. I mean, listen, we're talking about __practice__. Not a game! Not a game! Not a game! We're talking about __practice__. Not a game; not the game that I go out there and die for and play every game like it's my last, not the game, we're talking about __practice__, man. I mean, how silly is that? We're talking about __practice__. I know I'm supposed to be there, I know I'm supposed to lead by example, I know that. And I'm not shoving it aside like it don't mean anything. I know it's important. I do. I honestly do. But we're talking about __practice__, man. What are we talking about? __Practice__? We're talking about __practice__, man!

>We're talking about __practice__! We're talking about __practice__... We ain't talking about the game! We're talking about __practice__, man!
